# Social_Media_Sentiment_Analysis
Social Media Sentiment Analysis is the process of analyzing the attitudes and opinions expressed by users on social media platforms towards specific topics, brands, or events. The analysis involves collecting and analyzing data from social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others, to extract and measure the sentiments expressed in the messages posted by users and involves the use of natural language processing, machine learning, and data mining techniques to classify and quantify the sentiment of social media posts, such as tweets, comments, and reviews.

In this project, I have used the Kaggle Dataset named Tweets.csv. This file consists of feelings posted by travelers on Twitter regarding the quality of services offered by the US Airline.

So that we can see what the opinion of the majority of travelers is regarding the services offered.

In this project, I have achieved an accuracy of 96%.
